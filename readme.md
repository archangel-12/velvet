### What is Velvet?
> it's a chatbot! but the answer is all in history ü§ó

### What is that supposed to mean?
It's a chatbot whose answers are coded and programmed to prioritize the notion of history above all, and to make it interesting for students by showing how fun history can be through meaningful and engaging conversations.

### Why am i doing this?
The ultimate reason I created this project is because I love the idea of multidisciplinary subjects. I believe that if history can be integrated with artificial intelligence, it could unlock groundbreaking insights that humanity has never imagined, or help us discover things we've never considered before.

This project is just a small proof that anyone can do amazing things with AI in a positive and hopefully meaningful way. It‚Äôs all about using it with care and clear intent to educate children, especially in a subject like history, which is often seen as lame and boring. As the developer, I aim to change that, to make history more fun and truly engaging.

### What tools and plugins did you use while creating Velvet?
   1. Any kind of *Virtual* IDE: Primarily used <a href="https://gitpod.io/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-gitpod-orange?logo=gitpod&logoColor=white&label=" alt="gitpod" /></a> or <a href="https://idx.dev/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/project%20idx-beta-blue?logo=googlecloud&logoColor=white" alt="idx.dev"/></a> for a cloud-based development environment.

   2. Runtime: Leveraged <a href="https://bun.sh/">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Bun-%23000000.svg?logo=bun&logoColor=white" alt="bun"></a> for its performance and modern <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-%23F7DF1E.svg?logo=javascript&logoColor=white" alt="js"></a> runtime capabilities.

   3. Framework: Built the project using <a href="https://nextjs.org/">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-%23000000.svg?logo=next.js&logoColor=white" alt="next"></a> for its robust features and [server-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering).

   4. Styling: Implemented <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwind.css-%2338B2AC.svg?logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=white" alt="Tailwind CSS"></a> for utility-first styling.
   
   5. Component Library: Used <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/shadcn/ui-%2318181B.svg?logo=vercel&logoColor=white" alt="shadcn/ui"></a> to streamline ui development.

   6. Language: Mostly in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-%23007ACC.svg?logo=typescript&logoColor=white" alt="TypeScript"></a> for type safety and maintainability.

   7. LLM Provider: [Groq](https://groq.com/), chosen for its free access to a wide range of LLM

   8. Using [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) as the sole LLM for this chatbot

   9. And finally, using <a href="https://dashboard.clerk.com/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Clerk-6C47FF?logo=clerk&logoColor=white" alt="shadcn/ui"></a> for database related management such as sign-in off option and account processing
