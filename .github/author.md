##### matthew alexander is the embodiment of everything a Gen-Z guy shouldn’t be. at protests, he’s that guy documenting police brutality like he's auditioning for a gritty reboot of Straight Outta Compton: N.W.A.’s “fuck the police” practically plays in the background every time he hits record. and when his clips go viral on twitter (or whatever we're calling it this week), he ends up chatting with journalists who are just trying to figure out what kind of fever dream they're witnessing. honestly, it's a miracle he’s not already topping his country’s most-wanted list, especially now that the new regime is flirting with competitive authoritarianism. and if things really go off the rails? oh, he’s got wildcards up his sleeve. escape plans. backup escape plans. because, let’s face it: in his homeland, raw talent usually gets two things: [ignored](https://youtu.be/nZPlNHItG-8?si=ZxFCW-hCMGxKm-v_) or [disappeared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997%E2%80%9398_activists_kidnappings_in_Indonesia)...

some of his wild take, quoting from [saul goodman](https://twitter.com/vincentrcrd):
"*~~nationalism will always be a stupid idea for me. you shouldn't love a country that doesn't love you back. you shouldn't love a country that doesn't even protect your rights. you shouldn't love a country that makes your life more complicated just because you're different and mean harm to anyone~~*"
